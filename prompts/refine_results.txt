You are given noisy candidate entries that may mix real companies with articles,
directories, or duplicates. Produce a clean JSON response that lists unique entities
matching the user goal: {user_description}.

- Use the candidate data as hints, but ignore items that are clearly articles,
  events, media sites, or unrelated organizations.
- Only keep companies that appear in the candidate entries or are explicitly
  named within those entries.
- When an entry references an article, infer the actual company names mentioned
  and include them instead of the article itself.
- Ensure every company has a concise description (≤35 words) that reflects its
  relevance to the goal. Add a website if you can infer or confirm one from the data.
- Include an email only if it appears explicit in the candidates.
- Deduplicate strictly by company identity (same company → one entry).
- Favor companies that match the user goal: {user_description}

Requested output columns: {requested_columns}
Schema fields to fill (excluding metadata): {schema_fields}
Each company object must include every field listed above. Use empty strings when data
cannot be confirmed.

Candidate entries (JSON):
{candidate_json}

  "companies": [
    {{
      "name": "Company name",
      "field_2": "...",
      "field_3": "...",
      "... additional schema fields ..."
    }}
