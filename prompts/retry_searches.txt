Generate {per_batch} new or refined search tasks to help the system reach the
minimum item target. Use the description, previous performance report, and user
feedback. Avoid repeating weak strategies unless you can improve them.

User description:
{description}

Performance report (JSON):
{performance_report}

Active schema columns:
{schema}

Accumulated feedback:
{additional_feedback}

Return JSON in the same structure as the initial generation step:
{{
  "searches": [
    {{
      "id": "string identifier",
      "query": "search query string",
      "strategy": "web|news|agg",
      "rationale": "optional note"
    }}
  ]
}}
